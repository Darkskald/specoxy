This project is an experiment: create functionality for scientific data management in **Rust**
and make it available in Python.

## Background

Python is very nice in terms of flexibility and prototyping, but it lacks the advantages of
static typing and, if no C or Fortran binding is employed, also performance. From the perspective
of a scientist, wouldn't is be nice to

- access experimental in a type-safe manner?
- import CSV files at the speed of rust?
- enjoy the strong scientific ecosystem of Python with some extras?

That's what this experiment is about!
